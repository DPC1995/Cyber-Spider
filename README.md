# Cyber-Spider
So, in your final CS32 project for Winter 2016, your goal is to build a set of C++ classes that can be used to implement an unknown attack detection system… a Cyber Spider that crawls the attack web. Your classes MUST be able to identify unknown threats (files and URLs) by discovering relationships between them and known threat indicators (known bad files and known bad URLs) through the analysis of log data of the types described above ({C,W,F}, {C,F,G}, and {C,F,W}). However, rather than requiring you to analyze trillions of lines of log data, your program will have to analyze only hundreds of thousands to millions of log lines to prove that the general approach works. Lucky you – this makes the problem much simpler!
